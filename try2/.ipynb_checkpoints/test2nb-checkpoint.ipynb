The \\nfact that you blessed me to be your Pradhan Sevak at an extremely important time in the history of our \\ncountry inspires me to work ever harder. In the last ten years, every moment of our time and every ounce of \\nour energy has been dedicated for the people’s welfare.\\nWith your trust and support, the nation has seen a massive transformation over the last ten years. While \\ndevelopment attained an unprecedented speed and scale, a signiﬁcant transformation has also happened in \\nterms of mindset.\\nToday, our youth are speaking of creating Viksit Bharat by 2047 as a goal that is attainable, as a milestone \\nthat will certainly be reached. The nation is conﬁdent on its journey of becoming self-reliant (Aatmanirbhar). \\nThis is a big change from the atmosphere of desperation and frustration that the nation had experienced in \\nthe decade prior to 2014 due to the corruption, policy paralysis and misrule by the government of those \\ntimes.\\nWe have gone from a nation that was in the ‘Fragile Five’ to a nation that is one of the top 5 economies of \\nthe world. The most important facet of this progress is that the fruits of development reached everyone, \\nespecially those who needed it the most. The mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka \\nPrayas has guided our actions.\\nThe nation’s growth has been powered by the victory of 25 crore people in the battle against poverty. These \\nare people who had suffered decades of deprivation of even basic necessities. Today, not only are they \\nbeneﬁting from our saturation approach in basic needs like bank accounts, gas connections, toilets, water, \\nelectricity, etc, but they are also being empowered with new-age facilities like optic ﬁbre connections, digital \\nsolutions, drones, etc.\\nThe nation’s growth has come from the drastic socio-economic transformation seen in the lives of women, \\nfarmers, ﬁsherfolks, street vendors, small entrepreneurs, SC, ST and OBC communities. They are being \\ndirectly empowered through the power of technology such as the JAM trinity.\\nFarmers have been a backbone of our nation’s progress.
